## Lecture 1

### Installation & First Program

1. **Install Java**
   - Install JDK ([Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html))
   - Install IntelliJ IDEA ([Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac))
     **OR**
   - Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) - Preferred ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

2. **Sample Code**
   - **Functions**: 
     - A function is a block of code that takes input, performs operations, and returns output.
     - Functions stored inside classes are called methods.
     - The function used is called `main`.

     - A class can have properties and functions (methods).
     - The class used is `Main`.

3. **Our 1st Program**
   - Create a new Java file named `Main.java`.
   - Add the following code to `Main.java`:

```java
public class Main {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Our 1st Program
       System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
